## Purpose

This paper consists of a set of short answer and several long answer questions. They require the student to solve problems, hence the time allocation. Results determine if students will be invited to participate in the next round (in January), and ultimately on to the team for the IPhO. Students at this level typically achieve 70-80/80, but considerably lower scores indicate a level of achievement that should in itself be considered by pupil and school a profound depth of development, skill at the subject. And a determination to solve hard physics problems. This paper is a challenge and is not an A level replica. It is a very tall ladder of skill, ability and preparedness which students climb until they grind to a halt. Good students should be encouraged to prepare for it and have a go; participation itself reflects well on a student’s interest and determination. Papers are returned to Oxford for marking.

## Award allocation

Certificates are awarded to the top students in approximately the following numbers:

* 50 Gold (Top 50)
* 50 Gold
* 100 Silver
* 200 Bronze I
* 200 Bronze II
* 200 Commendations

Book prizes are also awarded for Top gold awards winners.

Students achieving a certificate of any colour in the BPhO are very able physicists. We would encourage schools to present these certificates in a manner that recognises the significant achievement of successful students at a national level.
