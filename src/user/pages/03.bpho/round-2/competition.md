## Award allocation

Certificates are awarded to the top students in approximately the following numbers:

* 15 Distinction
* 15 Merit
* 30 Commendations

Students achieving a certificate of any colour in the BPhO are very able physicists. We would encourage schools to present these certificates in a manner that recognises the significant achievement of successful students at a national level.
