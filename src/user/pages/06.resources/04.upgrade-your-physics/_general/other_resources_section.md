These notes were produced by Anton Machacek, Head of Physics at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe; Academic Visitor in the sub-department of Atomic and Laser Physics, University of Oxford and valued member of the British Physics Olympiad Committee.

The notes were originally written to help students preparing to compete in the International Physics Olympiad, and aim to bridge the gap between British A2 level courses and the IPhO syllabus. However, they may also be of use to any students interested in furthering their knowledge and understanding of advanced-level Physics.
