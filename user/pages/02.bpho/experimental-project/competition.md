The Experimental Project was introduced in 2007. It was developed to support and encourage practical physics students in school. An interesting problem is posed, to be investigated using common household and school equipment. The project is written up in the style of an academic paper.

The Experimental Project gives students hands-on experience of  how experimental research is carried out - planning and undertaking open-ended experiments and independent research, working in teams where appropriate and communicating their findings.

Each school encourages as many students as they would like to produce a project. Some use it as a class or homework activity, others encourage science club or gifted and talented students to take part. The deadline for project submission this year is 7th December 2016. Within each school teachers judge their students efforts. Each school forwards their best project from each judging category to BPhO Office.

The competition is judged in two categories - Group A, for years 12 to 13 (AS and A2 or equivalent level students) and Group G for students in year 10 or 11 (GCSE or equivalent level). Prizes are awarded to students with outstanding papers, and the best team (of two) from each age group will be invited along with their teacher to the BPhO Presentations at the Royal Society in April. The best papers may be published on the BPhO website.
