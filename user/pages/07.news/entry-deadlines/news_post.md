Entry deadlines were omitted from the Physics Challenge (for GCSE) and AS Competition entry forms. Please note the deadlines for entering these competitions are:

Physics Challenge (GCSE, 6th March): 22nd February 2009

AS Competition (AS, 13th March): 27th February 2009

We will do our best, but cannot guarantee that papers will arrive on time if entries are received after these deadlines. Many schools also received an incorrect version of the Physics Challenge entry from. This should refer to GCSE not AS papers. We apologise for this error.
