Are you looking for an interesting project to keep your GCSE or AS students occupied after exams? This year, the BPhO have released their Practical Project early so that teachers can choose to use it during the post exams period.

Students in both age groups complete the same experiment, but are judged against their peers. The contest is free to enter, everyone who completes a project gets a certificate and the national winners receive a datalogger for their school!
