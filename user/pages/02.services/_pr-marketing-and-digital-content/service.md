In the age of information overload the importance of great content to engage your audienceis a given. Whether it’s a global integrated marketing campaign based on market modelling, a benchmarking survey, a freedom of information report or a research study or a simple media alert on a key issue that you want to become associated with; campaign success depends on how well it resonates.

We will work with you to maximise the types of content that can be created from a single event or campaign. In the planning stage we determine the platforms we want to use and then evaluate appropriate content. This could be anything from reports, online barometers, infographics, blogs, social media posts, microsites and video to traditional PR content such as contributed articles, press releases, media alerts and case studies.

Two things make our content creation capabilities stand out. The first is that we know
how to produce the data-driven content that people can’t resist clicking on and has sufficient credibility
to be used to influence behaviour change. The second is that we recognise that speed is often the only thing that counts – we make it our business to know what you’d say and are able to create comment in minutes to respond to a topical issue. For us it’s ultimately about taking the headache of content away from you and ensuring it drives the results you are looking for.
