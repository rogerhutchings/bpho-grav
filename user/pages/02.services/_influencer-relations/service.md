As inbound marketing becomes the most effective route to reach prospects, understanding how to engage an audience is crucial to success. Telling a good story is fundamental to business growth. It’s not easy, but we have the experience and know-how, as a result of working with both global brands and start-ups, to make it happen – with UK journalists voting us number one for story quality. Our clients will tell you that a PR-led story is the only proven route to engagement. After all, if a journalist thinks a story is interesting enough to share with the wider world, that same story will stand out against the competition on social, paid or owned channels. We prioritise activating the influencers in your market: By engaging the people that your prospects and customers listen to, your story will spread more quickly and receive more attention. Whether it’s press coverage in the Financial Times, being part of influential social networks or getting attention from analysts, our role is to deliver the momentum and credibility that brings your audience closer.
