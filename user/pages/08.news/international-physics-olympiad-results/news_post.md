The United Kingdom recorded an excellent result at this year's International Physics Olympiad. Swine flu threatened to cancel the event, held in Mérida, Mexico, but excellent efforts by our hosts enabled most countries to attend.

James Taylor, Guy Emerson and Sergei Patiakin were achieved Silver Medals, awarded to students in the top 25% of participants, and Benjamin Dive and Jordan Rush both achieved Bronze Medals, awarded to those in the top 50%.

This is one of the UK team's best results for some years, and congratulations must go both to the team, their leaders Robin Hughes, Guy Bagnall and Paul Nicholls, and all other members of the BPhO team who helped prepare the students. An excellent platform to prepare for Croatia 2010.
