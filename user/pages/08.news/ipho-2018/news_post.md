In July, the team of five BPhO 2018 finalists represented the UK in the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) in Portugal. After a couple of very tough days of competition papers and some strenuous marking the team were awarded one silver and four bronze medals; a tally that we are delighted and relieved by. Well done to our team.

The students were resilient and ready to face the challenge of both the theory and experimental papers.The practical exam included a very interesting couple of experiments, but that might be dependent on which side of the lab bench you were standing. The team coped with the challenge and having done quite a few past IPhO practicals in preparation, they knew that it was going to be tough. 

Taking every opportunity to play cards and meet students from other countries, our team also enjoyed the social activties following the exams. 

Next yearâ€™s (July 2019) IPhO takes place in Tel Aviv, Israel and, for a chance to compete, students must enter BPhO Round 1 in November.
