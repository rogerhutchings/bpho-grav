In 1979, Bill Jarvis was the editor of “Queries in Physics” (QIP), a broadsheet of questions and answers, mainly from teachers. QIP was founded by the late John Jenkins when he was Head of Physics at Gordonstoun School. Excerpts from the broadsheet came to be published in Physics Education.

One contributor, Willie Yong, came over from Singapore and stayed a while with the Jarvises in Lancashire. Willie was a physicist, educator, and entrepreneur. During his stay Willie asked why the UK did not take part in the annual International Physics Olympiad (IPhO). The answer was that nobody seemed to have heard of it!

The late Gordon Cawthorne (Physics lecturer) used to do sketches to brighten up “QIP”; and with Bill he started to ask around. Many UK Physics teachers became interested in selecting and coaching a team to attend an IPhO.

Gordon rustled up support through 1982/3; and when his health began to let him down, he was glad to hand over to Cyril Isenberg, who worked tirelessly as Hon. Secretary until very recently. Many volunteer science teachers have given their time and expertise since 1982.

In particular, the late Colin Siddons (teacher and lecturer) attended the IPhO in 1983, in Bucharest, as an Observer, and reported back that it was definitely something we should compete in. Colin was fluent in written and spoken Russian, which was a great advantage but during a “rest day”, Colin made the complicated journey to see Castle Dracula. When he got there, it was closed.

There was enough interest to select, by examination, a UK team and in 1984 our team attended the IPhO for the first time, at Sigtuna near Stockholm in Sweden. They did very well, all coming near the top of the list of awards.

Cyril wrote in more detail about the 1984 BPhO and IPhO, in Phys Educ Vol 19, 1984, p 253 (see below).

In 1986, the UK were invited at short notice to host the IPhO; and Guy Bagnall, Head of Physics at Harrow School, headed a team which managed to get everything in place with little time to spare. The meeting was a great success. Once again the UK team won awards near the top of the table. The question papers can be found here.

The UK hosted the IPhO again in 2000. More information about the event can be found here.

## Physics Education 1984

Below are extracts from a paper submitted to Physics Education in 1984 by Cyril Isenberg describing how the competition began that year.

> "Since 1967 a number of European countries have sent a team of five pre-university physics students to the International Physics Olympiad which is held each year in Europe...

> This year, for the first time, Britain sent a team to the International Olympiad. The initiative for this came from Bill Jarvis, a teacher and entrepreneur. He persuaded me to set up a British Physics Olympiad Committee to select a team for the 1984 Olympiad, which was held near Stockholm, in Sweden, on 23-31 July. Thus we set what most school teachers would call an exceedingly challenging paper for a good sixth-form student. It was thought that this would enable us to pick out the very best students in Britain. These students would probably be going up to university in the Autumn of 1984. This indeed turned out to be the case...

> On Friday 9 March sixth-formers throughout Britain tackled the first British Physics Olympiad examination paper, which consisted of four substantial questions. It was thought by the Committee that a prospective British team member would be able to complete one question and attempt parts of the remaining three questions. This proved to be the case. The students who produced the best five scripts were selected for the team to visit Sweden later in the year"
