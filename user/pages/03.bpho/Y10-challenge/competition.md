The BPhO Year 10 Physics Challenge is open to students 14 to 15 years old.  The competition consist of two twenty-five minute online multiple choice papers (30 questions per paper).

The questions will be based on an assortment from Dynamics, Electricity, Optics, Heat, Units, small amounts of Astronomy, Waves, to give the main topics. Some questions are done by a process of elimination, some are general knowledge and not classroom physics, some is from the school curriculum. It is closer to a Quiz than an exam.

**Registering your school**: Registration is open from now until the 2nd May. To order, visit the online store. Login details with instructions will be emailed out after 5.00pm on the 2nd May. This will enable teachers to set the accounts for pupils who wish to participate.

**When to taken the test**: BPhO Year 10 Physics Challenge 2018 will take place between 3rd - 17th May 2019. The competition consists of two, 25-minute online tests that can be sat continuously on 2 separate occasions. The competitions are taken in school under staff-supervised conditions at any time convenient during the competition dates. A desktop or laptop is needed for this exam. iPad can be used but the system  is not optimised for small or touch screens. Calculators, pens and paper should be available.

**Prizes**: Schools will be able to conduct the BPhO Year 10 Physics Challenge in whatever way best suits their pupils, ensuring that they enjoy participating and have a reasonable expectation of recognition for their achievements. Their pupils' scores will be used to offer selected students a place on a one-day workshop in the Department of Physics, University of Oxford. Schools will be encouraged to award their own prizes and to make use of certificates provided for them.

**Further details**: The Year 10 Physics competition is designed to engage and challenge students of all abilities by offering them a range of problems to solve. Although most of the questions are based around the current GCSE curriculum, students will be able to gain more marks if they have a general knowledge in physics as well as taking a keen interest in practical work in lessons. The key aim is that students enjoy taking part and are encouraged to do more physics. They do not need to cover technical topics outside the syllabus, but they might be shown some pictures of famous physics and asked to identify one (Hawking, Galileo or Newton for example). Some general knowledge and everyday interest in physics would be an advantage. The purpose is to fun for the student and to be inclusive rather than discriminating between very able candidates.
