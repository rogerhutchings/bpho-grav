The British Physics Olympiad is run by the BPhO Administrator, assisted by a dedicated committee of volunteer physics teachers and academics.

If you are interested in helping with the British Physics Olympiad, please contact the BPhO Administrator on [BPhO@physics.ox.ac.uk](mailto:BPhO@physics.ox.ac.uk)

There is always an opportunity for new teachers with an interest education and who wish to develop their problem solving skills, knowledge of physics at the school/university interface, materials to challenge the most able students in the subject, and to engage with the national physics team for the IPhO, to become involved in one of the many aspects of the BPhO. From writing questions, checking exam papers, supporting students through online mentoring, coming to one of the training camps, developing questions for the team, helping with practical experimental training or helping to develop the BPhO in new ways, there are many opportunities open to those teachers who want to work with, contribute to, and learn from a team of experienced and skilled teachers.  With the introduction of the British Astronomy & Astrophysics Olympiad, we are looking for interest and expertise in a new field. Teachers develop their skills through gradually becoming involved and one does not join the team as a fully-fledged expert in this field. We also use paid graduate students from Oxford to mark the BPhO papers at points during the year. If you are interested marking papers for the BAAO, please contact the BPhO Administrator.

- Invigilation and tutoring at the Final Selection Weekend in University of Oxford and Team Training at Trinity College, Cambridge.

We offer scholarship each year for a teacher to attend the International Physics Olympiad each year.

In 2011 the IPhO travelling scholarship was awarded to Mr Jaynarain Hurry (St. Simon Stock School).

We also use paid graduate students from Oxford and nearby Universities to mark the BPhO papers at points during the year. If you are interested marking papers, please contact the BPhO Administrator.
