Unfortunately there was a printing error in the Teachers Pack sent to schools earlier this month.The buff 2009 Physics Challenge entry form incorrectly refers to Year 12 students and AS papers. This form should refer to Year 11 students and GCSE papers. Please cross out the incorrect information and use the form as usual. The pink 2009 AS Competition form should be used to enter the AS Competition.

Teachers who have not received a pack through the post can request one from [BPhO@physics.ox.ac.uk](mailto:BPhO@physics.ox.ac.uk).
