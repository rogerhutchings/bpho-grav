## Online Store

To order papers, visit [the University of Oxford online store](https://www.oxforduniversitystores.co.uk/product-catalogue/physics/bpho-201819).

The papers and certificates are listed under 'physics' and 'BPhO'.

 If you need help using the online store, see this [How To document](How_to_shop.pdf), or email [BPhO@physics.ox.ac.uk](mailto:BPhO@physics.ox.ac.uk).

## Free entry

We offer two free entries for all non-fee paying schools, due to sponsorship from a private donor, which has been allocated to BPhO to widen participation.

The AS and GCSE Challenge papers are also available free electronically to all schools. Please use the online shop to order your free electronic copies of the paper, mark scheme and certificates.
