The AS Challenge is an exciting opportunity for students to stretch their lateral thinking skills and apply fundamental physical principles to novel situations. The AS Challenge is a single, one-hour paper that provides an excellent tool to assess and challenge studentâ€™s ability to work at Key Stage 5 and beyond. It consists of ~10 minutes of thought-provoking multiple choice questions followed by a short answers section that tests subject knowledge and application.

Papers and mark scheme are sent to teachers on receipt of an entry form. After completion, teachers mark the scripts and send a record of marks to the BPhO. Bronze, Silver or Gold Certificates are issued to students reaching a threshold mark and Participation Certificates issued to all those taking part. Five of the top scorers from the AS competition (and their teachers) are invited to the April prize-giving at the Royal Society.
