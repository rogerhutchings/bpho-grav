## Why take part?

The British Physics Olympiad (BPhO) aims to encourage the study of Physics and recognise excellence in young physicists through four annual Physics competitions.

The competitions are designed to test understanding and problem solving skills and are open to able young physicists in school years 11-13 (GCSE to A2 or equivalent).

Participation in a British Physics Olympiad is a challenge for able students which allows them to:

- Have fun problem solving
- Test their knowledge with stimulating questions 
- See the real-world problem-solving potential of Physics 
- Practice open-ended and unstructured questions, as seen at higher levels of study 
- Gain a prestigious award for CVs and UCAS forms
- Win Certificates and book prizes
- Develop the skills required for admission to the top universities
- Compare their attainment with students from all over the United Kingdom
- Qualify for additional training with the best students, and the chance to represent Britain at the International Physics Olympiad.
